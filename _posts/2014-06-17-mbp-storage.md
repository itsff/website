At [Trading Technologies](/2014/06/8-years-at-tt/ "Trading Technologies") we recently switched to laptop-centric culture. Our desktops got lugged away and everyone can choose what kind of laptop they would like to have. I was one of the pilot MacBook Pro users and I got mine over 18 months ago. It took me a while to get used to it, but it completely changed the way I work. It's so easy to just grab a laptop and crash a meeting room with two other devs. This makes communication so much easier. Not to mention I can now work on the train. Every company should consider this!

Unfortunately my Mac came with only 256 gigs of storage. For a developer that's not that much.Â Especially that I use a lot of OSs on many VMs. I asked our IT, and they listened. It came earlier today. [LaCieÂ external SSD with USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820154047). It's a speedyÂ ~250MB/sec.

I really had a lot of fun velcroing it to my Mac. What do you think? Geeky enough for you? ðŸ˜‰

Behold:
