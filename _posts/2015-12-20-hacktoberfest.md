I finally got my [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) gearÂ from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). It was a fun opportunity to contribute to open-source projects while scoring a sweet t-shirt.
I fixed some annoying bugs in the [weld build system](https://github.com/itsff/weld) that I've been using for my personal C++ projects. Hope you guys enjoy.

Naturally this &#8220;hacktoberfest&#8221; made me take a closer look at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and what they have to offer. I've gotta say: I'm impressed! Seldom one finds such fast and cost-effective cloud providers. I've been using [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) and [CloudAtCost](http://cloudatcost.com/), but now I am seriously thinking of migrating at least some of my projects to DigitalOcean. Well done, sirs, well done!
