I finally had some time to release a much-needed update to my free mortgage calculator for Window Phone 7. [Mo Calc](http://basically.me/Apps/MoCalc) 1.2 sports a new payment summary page with pie charts to better visualize payments structure.

I also revamped the comparison page. I decided to hide the detailed numbers and only display the monthly and total payments, in order to fit more items on the screen. The details are still available – just click &#8220;show details&#8221; to expand them.

I felt that the amortization table was pretty useless in the previous version. Who wants to scroll through 360 months of rows to see just a bunch of numbers? My plan is to gradually start improving it and making it more user-friendly. Version 1.2 has a &#8220;quick jump&#8221; capability (alike the people hub in Windows Phone 7) allowing quick hop to a designated year. Click on the year header to activate it.

There were also other miscellaneous improvements that made it to this version. Here is the list:

Version 1.2

  * Improved payment summary page
  * Added pie charts
  * Improved amortization table
  * Using large numeric keyboard for number input
  * Added collapsible details for mortgage comparisons
  * Performance improvements and bug fixes
  * New icon and splash screen
  * New About page

  <strong>Update:</strong> Looks like I made a simple &#8220;copy and paste&#8221; error and both charts are the same. Thank you TheManOfSteel27 for pointing that out. I already submitted an update to the Marketplace. Now just waiting for Microsoft to approve it.
