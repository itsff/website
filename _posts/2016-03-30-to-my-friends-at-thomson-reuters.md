Friends,

As most of you already know, my last day at Thomson Reuters will be this Friday, April 1st. Over the past 15 months, I have had the pleasure of working with some of the brightest (and nicest!) people in my career, on very forward-thinking projects. I have learned a ton and, most importantly, I had a lot of fun and made some good friends and memories.

Let us stay in touch. My personal email address is filip-at-fracz.net, I am also looking forward to connecting onÂ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/filipfracz" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.linkedin.com/in/filipfracz&source=gmail&ust=1493785073019000&usg=AFQjCNGFIh_Ri_BVjOiaFIRQya0ftGIa3g">LinkedIn</a>. I wish you best of luck in your future endeavors and hope we bump into each other again.

Best regards,  
Filip
