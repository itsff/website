One of the great things about working at a start-up is meeting passionate people. [Seed CX](http://www.seedcx.com) is no exception, as there are so many colorful personalities here. My jaw dropped to the floor when [Kevin Wojkovich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwojo314) brought his Atreus keyboard to the office. I mean I myself was sporting a [Goldtouch Go!2](https://shop.goldtouch.com/products/goldtouch-go2-wired-mobile-keyboard-pc-mac), but Kevin's beauty was simply on another level. I asked him about it and little did I know that this would be a beginning of a very fun, but expensive hobby for me.

Kevin opened a whole new world to me. He introduced me to the ortholinear key layout, and showed me his other keyboard - the [Infinity ErgoDox](https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/) - which he built from a kit.

## ErgoDox EZ

After a few weeks of intensive research, I finally decided to take a plunge. Since it would be my very first mechanical keyboard, I reckoned I'd skip the whole soldering part and just purchase a pre-made product. My choice was the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/). I went with white tilted model, with backlit keys. 

In addition to the rather classic `Kailh Brown` switches, I purchased a small set of `Kailh Thick Gold` speed switches. They are super fun and emit a crisp, high-pitched click on the down- and up-stroke. I use them for all the modifiers. Now my co-workers can really hear my enters and backspaces :grinning:. 
The folks at ErgoDox EZ really make customization a breeze. Switches are hot-swappable, so no soldering required. There are also thousands of keycap options. I couldn't help myself and ordered a few from eBay, Ali Express and Flashquark. As I mentioned earlier: this hobby can get quite expensive.

ErgoDox is all about customization - it supports up to 32 layers, and every single key is programmable. I devised my own layout based on my preferences and habits. I especially like that there's an ability to [change backlight of individual keys](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/wOwld/latest/1) based on layer. For example, I highlight all the numeric keys on my num layer. Same with function keys. Very useful feature!

It took me a while to get used to the ortholinear layout, but nowadays I am as productive as ever. Having the two halves spread out improves my posture, and minimizes shoulder and strain.

## DSA Keycaps

During the first few weeks of usage, I found myself constantly glancing down at the keyboard and searching for appropriate letters. Needless to say, it was very counterproductive. I also would get headaches from moving my eyes from one half of the keyboard to the next. To mitigate this, I decided to get rid of labels on keys alltogether.
[Flashquark](https://flashquark.com/) had a good deal, so I purchased a set of translucent DSA keycaps. I actually like that profile much better, as the keys are shorter and easier for me to press. Transparent keys forced me to just embracy my inner typist and now I ever even look at the keyboard, unless to mess with cool animations that is :wink:

## Hot Dox

It's nice to have a cool keyboard at the office, but what about those times when I work from home? Sounds like a great excuse to purchase another mech! This time around I went with `ErgoDox "Hot Dox"` by [Alpaca keyboards](https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/). No backlight, no tilting, but still hot-swappable switches and _way_ cheaper!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/itsff/46909773174/in/album-72157710695337826/" title="20190414_232525"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46909773174_8c3874e514_z.jpg" width="640" height="362" alt="20190414_232525"></a>

I'm using `red` linear switches for the alphas, `thick gold` for common modifiers, and `white` for remaining modifier keys. It's actually surprising how different each kind of switch feels! The whites are especially difficult to accidently press.
Some day I will get a more stylish set of keycaps, but for the time being I'm stuck with the camo.
