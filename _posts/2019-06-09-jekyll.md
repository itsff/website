My website has been running under WordPress for a few years now, and I have been mostly happy. Every once in a while, my docker container running MariaDB would die rendering the WordPress website unusable. I needed to `ssh` into my cloud server and bounce the containers. A lot of hassle all for nothing.

I decided to give static content generators a try. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) seems to be the most popular one, and has the added bonus of being the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). With the help of [WordPress to Jekyll plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter) I converted the old posts into markdown files. I am now hosting on GitHub itself: all my content is automagically versioned via `git`, site is always up, and I'm saving cash ordinarly spent on running docker containers. Win-win.

During migration I found this image extreamly helpful. It made the whole process much easier.

```sh
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -p "8000:4000" starefossen/github-pages
```
