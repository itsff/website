Another weekend, another project. My parents asked me for help getting their website up and running. They finally decided to share our tradition of making [paper snowflake cut-outs](http://FunSnowflakes.com) with the world. It was a neat little project.

My sister digitized all snowflake patterns in SVG format using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/ "Inkscape"). I wrote a simple script that &#8220;stitches&#8221; pages together and outputs PDFs. Pretty soon we created several awesome-looking eBooks. Then it was just a matter of putting together a website with a simple store. I used [ASP.NET MVC](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/) along with a cloud-based eCommerce basket called [Cashie](http://www.cashie.biz/ "Cashie"). It was super easy – basically a copy-and-paste of a few HTML lines. Cashie still [needs to add some](http://getsatisfaction.com/cashie/topics/cashie_should_hit_my_url_upon_successful_transaction) features (for example, there is still no way to know that the purchase has been completed), but overall it was a good experience.

But enough about technology. Let's talk about snowflakes. Making cut-outs is really a great passtime, especially for those cold winter evenings. It's also easy to get the kids involved. Snowflakes make neat holiday decorations and gifts.
