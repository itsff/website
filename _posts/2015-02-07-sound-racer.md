In January I started my new job with Thomson Reuters. It's in Oakbrook, so my commute is completely different than what I was used to. No more walking, no more Metra. Now it's all about Chicago traffic.

I was a little bit nervous whether I would be able to handle it or not. This is why I decided to treat myself to aÂ funky gadget. I purchased a [Bluetooth-enabled OBD II scanner](http://amzn.com/B00OMT6UEK "OBD II Scanner"), and promptly paired it with theÂ [SoundRacer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appagonia.SoundRacer&hl=en "SoundRacer") on my Android phone. The results can be seen (and heard) in the video below:



It's really tons of fun! The SoundRacer app reads the RPMs from the OBD II scanner, generates race car engine soundsÂ to match, and plays them through the car speakers. It really makes you want to rev the engine! Probably not a good thing if you want to avoid speeding tickets ðŸ™‚

Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that it's not feasible to have it on all the time. I just want to fly, but sometimes traffic just forces me to idle. Now I've switched andÂ enjoy listening to NPR and get a much needed break from electronics.Â It'sÂ very refreshing ðŸ™‚
