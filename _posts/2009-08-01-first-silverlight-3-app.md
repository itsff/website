Despite my earlier [blog post](/post/63249707094/mortgage-calculators), I decided to take part in the &#8220;sexiest&#8221; mortgage calculator contest after all. It seemed like a perfect excuse to give [Silverlight 3](http://www.silverlight.net) a try. The end result may not be the sexiest (I'm a developer, not a designer), but I think it’s fairly functional. Actually, I wish I had a tool like that when I was shopping for mortgages. I had a lot of fun writing this app, and I learned a lot.

**EDIT:** Nice – I just stumbled upon a [website of Rene de Paula jr](http://blogs.msdn.com/renedepaula/archive/2009/07/31/exemplo-bacana-de-aplica-o-financeira-em-silverlight.aspx) that mentions my calculator ([translation from Portuguese](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.msdn.com%2Frenedepaula%2Farchive%2F2009%2F07%2F31%2Fexemplo-bacana-de-aplica-o-financeira-em-silverlight.aspx)). News travel fast on the internets =)

**Update:** The results are in and while I did not win, I had a lot of fun learning Silverlight 3. Here are the submissions that won. Pretty cool, I must admit. They all tend to use standard JavaScript, Google Charts and Flash. I may revise my calculator and use some of their ideas.
