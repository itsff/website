Lately I have been doing a lot of asynchronous development. At work I'm designing a trading API that is very asynchronous in nature, and in my spare time I have been messing around with Silverlight.

I would like to share a few different patterns for retrieving data asynchronously that I have encountered. Hopefully my blog posts will be a good resource for you.
