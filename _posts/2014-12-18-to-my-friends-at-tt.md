  Hi Everyone,</p>

  <p>
    I would like to thank each and every one of you, who have been calling TT a second home for all these years. We share many great memories: our outings, team lunches, water cooler talks, as well as simple, honest, everyday work. You guys have touched my life, and I will cherish these moments forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    The greatest asset of TT has always been its people, and I have been very fortunate to have worked and learned from you. You are the reason this company is the powerhouse it is today. I am proud of our accomplishments.
  </p>

  <p>
    While I'm moving on to the next great thing, this is a small world and I hope our paths will cross again. I'm looking forward to staying in touch. My personal e-mail is filipfracz-=at=-gmail.com. Let's also connect on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/filipfracz" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.<br /> I wish you best of luck in your future endeavors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sincerely,
  </p>
