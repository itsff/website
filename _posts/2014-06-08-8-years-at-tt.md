I just noticed it has been a whole 8 years since I started working for [Trading Technologies](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/ "Trading Technologies"). I was hired fresh out of [college](http://umich.edu "The University of Michigan")Â and began my journeyÂ on May 15, 2006 (well, I did some consulting on the side before coming to ChiTown).

During my career at TT, I pretty much worked on everything the company has to offer.

I spent countless hours massaging our flagship [X_TRADER](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/products/trading-analytics/xtrader/ "X_TRADER") product. I was a keyÂ player in bringing .NET into the program and integrating it with native C++ and MFC. This really made adding new windows easier (have you ever had to deal with Win32/MFC?!) and allowed for tight [X_STUDY](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/products/trading-analytics/xtrader/xstudy/ "X_STUDY") integration.

&nbsp;

In order to achieve maximum performance, I completely rewrote the [Time & Sales](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/xtrader/introduction-to-time-and-sales/ "T&S") window. Both the stand-alone and one integrated into MD Trader. While working on T&S I learned a lot about grids and data virtualization.

Every trader who's copying/pasting links to and from Microsoft Excel goesÂ through my Link Manager. That was a very fun project which definitely provided a ton of value for our customers. There are thousandsÂ of traders who design their strategies in Excel spreadsheets and want their numbers to be shown onÂ [grids](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/autotrader/creating-links-from-excel-ole-links/), [charts](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/xstudy/linking-to-and-from-excel/), [ladders](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/xtrader/md-trader-and-managing-links/) and [algos](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/adl/dynamic-data-exchange-link/). And this works both ways â€“ I allow them to copy cells from X_TRADERÂ and insert them into Excel. The data flows flawlessly and everything just magically works.

For fun I also added preview to the [Color settings window](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/xtrader/colors-md-trader/), which finally made it usable.
I wrote so many things for X_TRADER that I actually lost track. Not to mention countless prototypes to fool around with new features. Definitely good times ðŸ™‚

&nbsp;

I am the architect and author of [TT API](https://developer.tradingtechnologies.com/tt-api "TT API") â€“ our high performance trading API for Windows. It was a greatÂ few years designing and implementing all the different features. I certainly learned a lot. TT API lets you trade any exchange that TT supports, including [Autospreader SE](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/products/trading-analytics/server-based-execution/autospreader-se/)Â and [Synthetic SE](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/products/trading-analytics/server-based-execution/synthetic-se/) engines.Â You can really go to town. Just check out TT API [samples on GitHub](https://github.com/tradingtechnologies/CodeSamples_TTAPI_CSharp).

It's also worth mentioning that internally our [Algo SE](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/products/trading-analytics/server-based-execution/algo-se/)Â serverÂ and [ADL (Algo Design Lab)](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/products/trading-analytics/xtrader/adl/ "Algo Design Lab") are bothÂ powered by my TT API.



&nbsp;

Two years ago I was selected to start on TT's future platform. The codename for it used to be &#8220;[Nextrader](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/company/news/news-releases/2014/140312-nextrader/)&#8220;, but due to trademark conflicts a new name was [chosen](http://tradetalk.tradingtechnologies.com/2014/09/next-gen-tt-platform.html).Â I <del>coined the name and</del> designed many low-level communication and security details (EdgeServer-to-client path, authorization, protocols, etc) which are now the foundation of the new system. I also led and directed the client-side team. Â The TTÂ platform is written from the ground up using modern technologies. It's optimized for speed. Trust me â€“ you will feel it ðŸ™‚



In addition to web-based interface, TT PlatformÂ will ship with an Android mobile app. That's another one of my babies. I designed the flow and general layout of the main screens for both phone and tablet form factors. Our in-house designer Kevin made them look awesome. I'm sure you will loveÂ it! Working on mobile is challenging, as it forces you to think from a different perspective and face a whole new set of problems. Limited screen real-estate, battery life, disconnect scenarios, butt dialing (or shall I say: butt trading) are all issues you have to deal with. I had a blast ðŸ™‚

I started writing iOS version of TT MobileÂ with my team, but I didn't get too far (enough to master Objective-C). I was needed on the new Algo project. Currently I am working with [Andrew Gottemoller](http://agottem.com "Andrew Gottemoller") on our _next-generation trading API_, which we internally callÂ TT SDK. The plan is to allow our customers to hand-craft their algos and run them in our co-lo facilities for minimum latency and maximum speed.

&nbsp;

TT SDK is lean. It is fast. Linux andÂ plain C. It is powerful, yet feels delightfully simple. Â In addition to C we will eventually provide wrappers for higher-level languages. I, naturally, already have a C++14 andÂ [Mono](http://mono-project.com) C# version going. Stay tuned!

&nbsp;

As you see, I've been having fun. Trading Technologies is a [great](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Trading-Technologies-Reviews-E38191.htm "Glassdoor reviews") company, but its most important asset are definitely the people. Everyone is smart and easy-going. IÂ made many good friends at TT and I'm happy to see them every day.
Let's see what the future will bring ðŸ™‚
