I was checking up on [Mo Calc](http://basically.me/apps/mocalc "Mortgage Payment Calculator - Mo Calc") over at Windows Phone 7 marketplace today and I came across an interesting finance app.

It's called [Loanster](http://blendesigner.com/2011/05/17/submitted-my-first-wp7-app-last-night/ "Loanster"). Check out these screenshots below:

  Despite drawing inspiration from Mo Calc, I am assured that Loanster is a completly legit and independently written app. Its author Tony was nice enough and agreed to tweak the UI in the next version in order to differentiate Loanster from Mo Calc a bit more.
