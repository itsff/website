Bing offers a nice way of searching for Windows Phone 7 apps, called &#8220;Visual Search&#8221;. I have noticed that the results are a little bit outdated compared to the Zune client but, nonetheless it's a cool tool for browsing.

Here's a link to the [Finance apps.

**Note:** The problem is that Marketplace search only includes titles! The descriptions and metadata are not searched. Sounds like another glitch to me.
