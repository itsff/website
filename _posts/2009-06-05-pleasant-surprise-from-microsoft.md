A while back I listened to Scott Hanselman’s <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=165">podcast with Noah Richards</a> about the new Visual Studio 2010 editor. It is a from scratch rewrite using WPF technologies. Noah mentioned that Microsoft will provide many hooks to the editor (via <a title="Managed Extensibility Framework" href="http://www.codeplex.com/MEF">MEF</a>), to make extensibility a snap. The overall message was that culture at Microsoft is slowly changing and that Microsoft is becoming more open (Noah’s apparently being called an “open source communist” by some old-timers).

I am a die hard fan of an open sorce Java editor (yes, Java!) called <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a>. It has many many features, but I love it for its block editing. I often find myself switching from Visual Studio to jEdit to massage my code. I decided to send some comments and suggestions to the VS editor team. I made <a href="http://youtu.be/cs0ptM1Rac8">two</a> simple <a href="http://youtu.be/KPUr-Na9s3c">videos</a> comparing block editing of VS and jEdit and forwarded them to Noah and his product managers. They were interested, but asked me to provide some use cases. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/basically_me_images/block_editing/VS2010+Block+Editing+Proposal.pdf">This is what I came up with</a>.

Today I searched the blogsphere and what do you know. It seems that Microsoft really did incorporate my feedback. Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vseditor/archive/2009/05/25/the-new-box-selection-now-with-multi-line-editing.aspx">the video Brittany Behrens posted</a>. Looks like she covered all my use cases (fortunately she changed the “dump” method name to a more pc “print”). Noah also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahric/archive/2009/05/12/box-selection.aspx">blogged</a> about the new features.

You can only imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to see that Microsoft is actually serious about taking feedback from the community. This definitively makes me want to contribute more. And I am that much more excited to give Visual Studio 2010 Beta2 a spin =)

<strong>Edit:</strong> ScottGu mentiones the box selection in his <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/04/26/box-selection-and-multi-line-editing-with-vs-2010.aspx">blog post</a>. It made the VS2010 RTM.
