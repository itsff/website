# CppCon 2021

This year I am very lucky to be able to attend CppCon 2021.
Last time I went, the conference was in Bellevue, WA but it now held in Aurora in Colorado.
It's indeed a nice change of scenery, with the Rocky Mountains just a stonethrow away.

Covid travel restrictions mean that there are only about 230 in-person attendees,
and many sessions are online-only. On the flip side, face-to-face presentations
feel more intimate and it's easier to ask questions and mingle.

As always, I've seen many familiar faces and was to reconnect with friends
and former co-workers. Shoutout to all the CTC peeps :-)
