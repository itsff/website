My friend [William](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamtbaker)Â just alerted me that our patent application has been published on the [USPTO website](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220160086272%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20160086272&RS=DN/20160086272).Â This dates back to our days at TT and it's titled &#8220;System, Method, and Tool for Synthetic Order Recovery&#8221;. While William already has a few patents in his pocket, this one is my first ðŸ™‚

> This patent document relates to a system, method, and tool for synthetic order recovery. In certain embodiments, an exemplary method includes detecting a server event associated with a synthetic order server identified by a synthetic order server identifier, wherein the synthetic order server is in communication with the recovery tool; determining at least one active synthetic order associated with the synthetic order server identifier; determining a child order status for each child order related to the at least one active synthetic order, wherein the child order status includes an updated child order quantity since the server event was detected, and wherein each child order is associated with the synthetic order server identifier; calculating an updated synthetic order quantity for each of the at least one active synthetic order and based on the updated child order quantity; generating a recovery package including the at least one active synthetic order and the updated synthetic order quantity; and communicating the recovery package to the synthetic order server associated with the synthetic order server identifier.
