I've been spending a good chunk of time commuting to and from work. Most of it being stuck in traffic on I-290. It can be a miserable experience, but listening to the radio helps. I also like looking around and spotting different license plates. Apparently custom plates are quite popular in Illinois.

Here we have a character from one of my favorite silentÂ [movies](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCkQtwIwAmoVChMI7InT1r71yAIVxGseCh2T0g0Z&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhJJK5sgkgVA&usg=AFQjCNFNgd2xdPND64EVJudkOnhf2U73CQ&sig2=Qm_z0mzTK1IYGaH5TqA25A). I spotted him on two different occasions. Oh, and the driver looks actually Indian!

Below is what mustÂ be President Obama visiting his home City of Chicago in his presidential Ford Taurus. Or perhaps this is his wife's car?

I decided to get a vanity plate of my own. It was actually quite easy: few clicks on a website and viola. The plate was on its way. It did take more than a month (just shy of 30 business days), but I finally got it today. Behold:

I really hope it will help me get out of speeding and parking tickets&#8230;Â or, at the very least, bring a smile to my fellow I-290 commuters ðŸ™‚
