By the magic of Twitter I [learned from sizeof](http://twitter.com/sizeof/status/2276848428) about a contest for the “[sexiest mortgage calculator](http://www.mortgageloanplace.com/mortgage-calculator.php)”. While my graphics skills leave much to wish for and I won’t participate, I found some cool links for mortgage calculators out there. I wish I knew about these when I was buying a house.

**Edit:** I did decide to participate and while I did not win, I had a lot of fun [learning Silverlight 3](http://blog.filipfracz.net/post.aspx?id=f1157dc9-4274-44ed-9f34-18044b20404b). Here are the submissions that won. Pretty cool, I must admit. They all tend to use standard JavaScript, Google Charts and Flash.
