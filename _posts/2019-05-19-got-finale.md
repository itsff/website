After eight years, the famous Game of Thrones series is finally over. The last season was a wild ride. I don't feel satisfied at all! 
Why didn't any major character die during the Battle of Winterfell?
Why didn't the Night King just bypass Winterfell and go straight for the 1 million strong King's Landing?
How come Gray Worm allowed John Snow to live at the end?

Reddit seems to agree that the last GoT season was very inconsistent.
