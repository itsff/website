Something I just thought of for my new [mobile project](http://blog.filipfracz.net/post/Back.aspx):

I also want to reuse as much code as I can between the WP7 and Android solutions. The code sharing part is what in my opinion will be most complicated. It seems like the two &#8220;camps&#8221; couldn't be further apart, and that there are no common tools available. It would be great if there was something like [MonoTouch](http://monotouch.net/ "MonoTouch by Novell") but for Android (MonoDroid, are you here yet?) so that I can code in C#&#8230;

Hopefully, with [Brad Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/) [working for Google](http://bradabrams.com/2010/05/going-google/), we will see a more .NET friendly Android. Time will tell. In the meantime, I need to figure something out.
