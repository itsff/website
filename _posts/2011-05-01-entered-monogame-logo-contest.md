The weather was lousy today, so I couldnâ€™t mow the grass. A shame, since I wanted to do something useful. I decided to get artsy while staying inside, so I entered the [MonoGame logo contest](http://monogame.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Logo%20Contest).

# Mono + Game = MonoGame

For the [MonoGame](http://monogame.codeplex.com) logo I wanted to use good visual associations so that the picture adequately describes the nature of the framework. Of course everyone knows the white monkey, which is synonymous with the [Mono project](http://www.mono-project.com). But when I think of the word &#8220;game&#8221;, a single image comes to me immediately. A single image which brings back a lot of memories from the good olâ€™ days. The long nights spent playingâ€¦ Pac-Man! (oh, yeah baby!) This is where I drew my inspiration from.

All versions of the logo feature a slightly rotated Mono monkey with its mouth wide open in the tribute to the well-known arcade character. In front of the monkey are four circles, each one containing a letter from the word &#8220;game&#8221; (Monospace typeface). The circles are meant to represent the food balls from Pac-Man. Not the small, normal ones. Oh no. These are the &#8220;power pellets&#8221; which give Pac-Man super powers!

# Version 1 â€“ Black and White

I am a fan of minimalism, so the first logo is black and white. It should nicely match the original Mono project logo.

# Version 2 â€“ Yellow Pac-Man Monkey

This version of the logo features the yellow color, which brings it closer to the popular arcade games character.

# Version 3 â€“ White Monkey, Color Pellets (my favorite)

This version of the logo is meant to express the affiliation of the MonoGame project as well as to underline the cross-platform characteristics of its framework. The Monkey is white to make strong association with the [Mono project](http://www.mono-project.com), while the pellets feature colors which are prominent in logos of popular operating systems:

  * Green â€“ Android 
  * Blue â€“ Mac/iOS 
  * Red â€“ FreeBSD 
  * Gold â€“ Linux (Tuxâ€™s beak) 
  * All colors â€“ Windows
