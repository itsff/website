So it finally happened! After all these years of hard work designing, implementing, and unnecessaryÂ re-writes (thanks [Rick](https://twitter.com/R1ck_L4n3)), the TT Platform is finally a [go](https://trade.tt "TT Platform"). This isÂ very exciting! Now anybody can sign up and try outÂ [my TT Mobile](http://filipfracz.net/2015/02/tt-mobile/ "TT Mobile showcase") client and enjoy the cloud trading experience.Â Great job team!

Take a look at the [official announcement page](http://tradetalk.tradingtechnologies.com/2015/03/tt-platform-available-worldwide.html).

While I wasn't able to find a link for the [TT SDK](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/the-tt-platform/apis/) download, I am certain that it will become available soon. I had a lot of fun working on the Algo Team, especially on TT SDK. It is the foundation of everything algo-related, including ADL.Â My friends who left TT are joking we should start offering TT SDK consulting services, since we are the ones who created it. That is actually not a far-fetched idea. Stay tuned ðŸ˜‰
