I really liked my gig at Thomson Reuters and had a great time working on my team. Reuters managed to gather very smart people, both in the US and in China. I had a blast.

What wasn't so cool was the commute on I-290. For the uninitiated, it's one of the busiest highways in Illinois. Despite the fact that I was &#8220;reverse commuting&#8221; the traffic would sometimes be brutal. NPR helped, but I felt like I was just wasting time sitting idly in the car.

Some friends reached out to me and I took the bait. I decided to join [Chicago Trading Company](http://www.chicagotrading.com/). Right downtown, so bye-bye commute, bye-bye I-290! I'm looking forward to my first day!
