Yesterday Microsoft finally reactivated my App Hub account so I was able to publish a long overdue Mo Calc update. It did take them a whole week and I still don't know what the issue was in the first place. I guess at this point I don't really care. To sweeten the deal Microsoft reimbursed my money and pre-paid the $99 for a yearly App Hub membership. That, plus my app was approved after only a few hours. Call me satisfied.
