Last night I migrated my dad's [SÅ‚ownik Polonijny](https://www.slownikpolonijny.com/) to my [DigitalOcean](/2016/01/docker-compose/) docker box. Originally it lived on Heroku (it's a Python Flask site), but I've been trying to consolidate my sites under one umbrella. No need to update you links, since the domain name is the same. One added bonus of this migration is SSL support, so others won't be able to see what funny polonized words you're looking at ðŸ˜‰
